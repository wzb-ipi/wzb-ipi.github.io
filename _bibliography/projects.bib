 description = {While research on poverty and political exclusion is omnipresent in the social sciences, the field of research on political and economic elites is rarely addressed. One reason for this is that the compartmentalization of one's own political activity can appear to be an instrument of power in itself. At the same time, however, the connections of the elites are of great interest to the public. Attending the same school or working in the same company can lead to personal ties, which in turn can influence decision-makers to the detriment of society. For example, a close relationship between legislators and business elites, such as CEOs and senior managers, can lead to policies that are more in line with the interests of specific companies than the interests of the public. At the other extreme, a complete lack of connections between political and business elites could lead to policies that completely disregard economic concerns. The link between elite connections and political inequality is therefore the main motivation for this project. The main objective is to compile a comprehensive global data set on political and economic elites. It will consist of a network matrix that shows the connections between individuals and allows us to visualize and analyze the relationships of elites within and between the economic and political spheres. In the initial phase of this project, we will manage the construction of this dataset, focusing on Germany and Uganda.},

Combining different strands of literature from political science, economics and business administration, we theorize how different government-business owner linkages, both domestically and internationally, determine a firm's willingness to comply with government orders to block Internet access, even if this would result in financial losses. By linking ISP data from TOSCO with VPN usage data, we determine which ISPs have blocked or censored internet access between 2017 and 2021.},

This project offers a novel way to measure different forms of online censorship and a systematic assessment of their consequences for offline mobilization. We also investigate whether increasing Internet access and use challenges authoritarian elections. Internet access provides both opposition supporters and government authorities with new means to shape electoral conduct. Overall, the results stress the important role that Internet access can play for opposition actors in authoritarian elections.

 description = {Policy projections and recent research suggest that large numbers of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa will continue to attempt to make their way to Europe over the next few decades. In response, European countries have made and continue to make significant investments in information campaigns designed to discourage irregular African migration. Despite the ubiquity of these campaigns, we know relatively little about potential migrants' prior knowledge and beliefs. To what extent are potential migrants actually misinformed about the migration journey and destination countries? We bring representative survey data collected in Benin City, Nigeria--a center of irregular migration--to bear on this question. Three key insights emerge. First, potential migrants are better informed about destination contexts than is commonly assumed, and if anything appear to underestimate the economic benefits of life in Europe. Second, they are relatively less well-informed about specific risks and other features of the irregular migration journey. Third, we find evidence of optimism bias. Respondents are generally hopeful when asked about Nigerian irregular migrants' prospects of being able to reach and stay in Europe, but they are especially optimistic when asked about their own chances. Taken together, these findings suggest that existing migration-related information campaigns, and with them a central component of migration policies in countries across the Global North, rest on shaky foundations. Most problematically, our study suggests that campaigns risk becoming misinformation campaigns, particularly when they suggest to potential migrants that they are overestimating the benefits of living in Europe.},

The Bayesian model allows for the pooling of data from eight studies on human trafficking prevalence, supported by the Prevalence Reduction Innovation Forum (PRIF), to assess the systematic bias of different estimation approaches. We compare these methods against benchmark estimates, such as those derived from the Horvitz-Thompson estimator on proportional samples. Our analysis, implemented using the hiddenmeta R package, provides insights into the accuracy and generalizability of existing estimation techniques for hidden populations. This research contributes to advancing methodological rigor in prevalence estimation, offering a comparative assessment of estimation biases across diverse real-world applications.},

We argue that violence can fuel both hostility toward the outgroup and acceptance of outgroup objectives and provide evidence from a unique survey of 1,380 respondents implemented by the authors in greater Khartoum in Sudan in 2010 and 2011. We find that Northerners who experienced rioting by Southerners in Khartoum in 2005 were more likely to support Southern independence but less likely to support citizenship for Southerners remaining in the North. In combination, these results suggest that political violence hardens negative intergroup attitudes and makes individuals willing to concede separation to avoid living alongside outgroup members.},

Working with a Lebanese NGO, we randomly assign Lebanese and Syrian youth participants to an ethnically heterogeneous or homogeneous classroom for a 12-week psycho-social support program. We further randomize whether participants received additional empathy education or a placebo curriculum focused on health and nutrition. We find that contact is more effective at teaching conflict resolution, but reduces the willingness to engage in further contact, as measured by attending an event celebrating the ougroup's culture. By contrast, empathy education decreases prejudice without negative effects on behavior. We do not find clear interaction effects of contact and empathy training, nor significant spillover effects among parents. The results point to the different trade-offs associated with both contact and empathy interventions in fragile settings.},

We contribute to this debate with an analysis of a never-before-used dataset of 35,000 school choice forms that parents must complete to enroll their child in elementary school.

Prominent perspectives in the state-building literature suggest that these policies are likely to threaten state consolidation by strengthening non-state authorities at the expense of state authority and subnational identities at the expense of a national identity. Leveraging spatial and temporal variation in the granting of communal land titles to indigenous communities in the Philippines, McMurry finds that titling can increase both indigenous self-identification and compliance with the state.},

In the context of this consultative process, our project seeks to: (1) contribute to strengthening the behavioral measurement of inequalities in political influence, (2) assess whether and how participation in setting the rules can flatten inequalities in citizens' willingness to take action to demand services, and to hold service providers to account, and (3) assess how the formalization of political rights and obligations can flatten these inequalities.},

Results suggest that outgroup avoidance online is widespread, associated with outgroup prejudice, explained by feelings of discomfort, anger, mistrust in outgroups, and pessimism, and challenging to overcome. Our findings indicate that avoidance is a barrier to constructive intergroup engagement in naturalistic settings, rendering many interventions that may be effective in controlled environments difficult to implement or scale in practice.},
