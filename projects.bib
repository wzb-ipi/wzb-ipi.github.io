  description = {This project collects and analyzes data on telecommunications ownership and control (TOSCO) to assess whether and how political connections influence the willingness of companies to comply with government requests to censor or block Internet access. The TOSCO dataset enables a comparative large-N analysis of the determinants and effects of different ownership structures and identities in the changing context of 49 African countries. Combining different strands of literature from political science, economics and business administration, we theorize how different government-business owner linkages, both domestically and internationally, determine a firm's willingness to comply with government orders to block Internet access, even if this would result in financial losses. By linking ISP data from TOSCO with VPN usage data, we determine which ISPs have blocked or censored internet access between 2017 and 2021.},

  description = {While research on poverty and political exclusion is omnipresent in the social sciences, the field of research on political and economic elites is rarely addressed. One reason for this is that the compartmentalization of one's own political activity can appear to be an instrument of power in itself. At the same time, however, the connections of the elites are of great interest to the public. Attending the same school or working in the same company can lead to personal ties, which in turn can influence decision-makers to the detriment of society. For example, a close relationship between legislators and business elites, such as CEOs and senior managers, can lead to policies that are more in line with the interests of specific companies than the interests of the public. At the other extreme, a complete lack of connections between political and business elites could lead to policies that completely disregard economic concerns. The link between elite connections and political inequality is therefore the main motivation for this project. The main objective is to compile a comprehensive global data set on political and economic elites. It will consist of a network matrix that shows the connections between individuals and allows us to visualize and analyze the relationships of elites within and between the economic and political spheres. In the initial phase of this project, we will manage the construction of this dataset, focusing on Germany and Uganda.},

  description = {Governments worldwide suppress access to information, often during times of contentious politics, such as elections or social unrest. While political scientists have thoroughly studied how increasing internet access and, in particular, access to social media has influenced protest behavior, research remains inconclusive about the consequences of a sudden loss of access to the internet for mobilization. In this project, we systematically assess how online censorship affects protest behavior offline. We use large-scale Virtual Network Provider (VPN) data for 26 authoritarian African countries from 2017 to 2021 to infer periods of temporary filtering and blocking of access to the internet. We then use two-way fixed effects regressions and a differences-in-differences with multiple time periods design to assess how sudden censorship events during periods of political contention affect protest behavior in the days and weeks following the event. Overall, this project offers a novel way to measure different forms of online censorship and a systematic assessment of their consequences for offline mobilization.},

  description = {Policy projections and recent research suggest that large numbers of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa will continue to attempt to make their way to Europe over the next few decades. In response, European countries have made and continue to make significant investments in information campaigns designed to discourage irregular African migration. Despite the ubiquity of these campaigns, we know relatively little about potential migrants' prior knowledge and beliefs. To what extent are potential migrants actually misinformed about the migration journey and destination countries? We bring representative survey data collected in Benin City, Nigeria—a center of irregular migration—to bear on this question. Three key insights emerge. First, potential migrants are better informed about destination contexts than is commonly assumed, and if anything appear to underestimate the economic benefits of life in Europe. Second, they are relatively less well-informed about specific risks and other features of the irregular migration journey. Third, we find evidence of optimism bias. Respondents are generally hopeful when asked about Nigerian irregular migrants' prospects of being able to reach and stay in Europe, but they are especially optimistic when asked about their own chances. Taken together, these findings suggest that existing migration-related information campaigns, and with them a central component of migration policies in countries across the Global North, rest on shaky foundations. Most problematically, our study suggests that campaigns risk becoming misinformation campaigns, particularly when they suggest to potential migrants that they are overestimating the benefits of living in Europe.},

  description = {Can intergroup contact improve relations between refugees and host communities? If so, are there added returns to combining contact and empathy education? Does either approach unlock spillover effects among household members? To answer these questions, we conduct a field experiment that brings together Syrian refugees and Lebanese nationals in three localities in Lebanon, where refugees make up a quarter of the population. Working with a Lebanese NGO, we randomly assign Lebanese and Syrian youth participants to an ethnically heterogeneous or homogeneous classroom for a 12-week psycho-social support program. We further randomize whether participants received additional empathy education or a placebo curriculum focused on health and nutrition. We find that contact is more effective at teaching conflict resolution, but reduces the willingness to engage in further contact, as measured by attending an event celebrating the ougroup’s culture. By contrast, empathy education decreases prejudice without negative effects on behavior. We do not find clear interaction effects of contact and empathy training, nor significant spillover effects among parents. The results point to the different trade-offs associated with both contact and empathy interventions in fragile settings.},

Anecdotal evidence suggests that non-migrant "natives" take steps to avoid or seek out catchment area schools due to the ethnic composition of student bodies. Indeed, school segregation has been documented across Europe, but the lack of high-resolution data on school choice and migrant populations has made it difficult to precisely show the extent to which schools are more (or less) segregated than we would expect given catchment area demographics and to analyze the process that leads to such segregation. We contribute to this debate with an analysis of a never-before-used dataset of 35,000 school choice forms that parents must complete to enroll their child in elementary school. We combine this data with a newly compiled set of administrative data on the street block and school zone level for the years 2000 to 2018, which includes demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, student population indicators, various school attributes, and school performance metrics.},

  description = {Alexandra Scacco and Shana Warren conducted an education-based field experiment—the Urban Youth Vocational Training (UYVT) course—to test whether sustained contact between members of groups in conflict can reduce prejudice and discrimination, increase cooperation, and limit support for violence. The UYVT program took place in the fall of 2014 in Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Kaduna has experienced deadly Christian-Muslim clashes over the past decade and has recently suffered from several brutal Boko Haram attacks.Subjects were drawn randomly from the city's most conflict-prone neighborhoods, participation in the UYVT program was offered to a random sample of 450 respondents, and participants were randomly assigned to religiously heterogeneous or homogeneous classrooms and study pairs. They find no meaningful changes in prejudice but a significant and robust reduction in discriminatory behaviors among participants assigned to the social contact treatments. To their knowledge, this is the first time social contact theory has been tested using empirically rigorous field methodology in an ongoing conflict environment, despite the fact that intergroup contact and engagement projects are one of the international community's most popular policy tools in addressing interethnic strife.},

Some suggest violence deepens antagonism and reduces support for compromise, while others contend it encourages moderation and concessions to prevent further conflict. We argue that violence can fuel both hostility toward the outgroup and acceptance of outgroup objectives and provide evidence from a unique survey of 1,380 respondents implemented by the authors in greater Khartoum in Sudan in 2010 and 2011. We find that Northerners who experienced rioting by Southerners in Khartoum in 2005 were more likely to support Southern independence but less likely to support citizenship for Southerners remaining in the North. In combination, these results suggest that political violence hardens negative intergroup attitudes and makes individuals willing to concede separation to avoid living alongside outgroup members.},

Our core hypothesis is that direct participation will enhance trust in local government, with effects moderated by initial perceptions of government reliability.

To this end, we conduct a survey experiment embedded in an in-person survey with 2,000 respondents in Zimbabwe in November 2024, examining how different framing strategies may affect beliefs shaped by government narratives. The study also investigates potential implications for citizen involvement in anti-regime mobilization, contributing to the literature on the ``repression-punishment puzzle''. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the conditions under which free media in competitive authoritarian regimes can challenge repressive governments by shaping public opinion.},

In “From Recognition to Integration: Indigenous Autonomy, State Authority, and National Identity in the Philippines,”  (APSR) McMurry asks how recognition of collective self-governance rights for indigenous communities affects national unity and state consolidation. In recent decades, many states have recognized such rights, devolving de jure control over land and local governance to indigenous institutions. Prominent perspectives in the state-building literature suggest that these policies are likely to threaten state consolidation by strengthening non-state authorities at the expense of state authority and subnational identities at the expense of a national identity. McMurry addresses this question head on by leveraging spatial and temporal variation in the granting of communal land titles to indigenous communities in the Philippines. Using difference-in-differences, panel data and survey experiments, she finds that contrary to received wisdom titling can increase both indigenous self-identification and compliance with the state.},
