title: Deterrence or Backlash? How Online Censorship Affects Offline Protest
img: assets/img/9.jpg
description: Governments worldwide suppress access to information, often during times of contentious politics, such as elections or social unrest. While political scientists have thoroughly studied how increasing internet access and, in particular, access to social media has influenced protest behavior, research remains inconclusive about the consequences of a sudden loss of access to the internet for mobilization. In this project, we systematically assess how online censorship affects protest behavior offline. We use large-scale Virtual Network Provider (VPN) data for 26 authoritarian African countries from 2017 to 2021 to infer periods of temporary filtering and blocking of access to the internet. We then use two-way fixed effects regressions and a differences-in-differences with multiple time periods design to assess how sudden censorship events during periods of political contention affect protest behavior in the days and weeks following the event. Overall, this project offers a novel way to measure different forms of online censorship and a systematic assessment of their consequences for offline mobilization.
