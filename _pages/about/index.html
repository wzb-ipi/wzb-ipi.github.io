These clusters stem from a focus on two types of social division: <strong>horizontal divisions</strong> between identity groups, and <strong>vertical divisions</strong> between those that have more or less political power.</p> <p>More about our research group can be found <a href="https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development/institutions-and-political-inequality" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> or in this <a href="https://wzb-ipi.github.io/assets/slides/ipi.html">presentation</a>.</p> <h3 id="contact">Contact</h3> <p>Reichpietschufer 50, 10785 Berlin</p> <p>ipi.office@wzb.eu</p> </body></html>
