### The institutions and political inequality research unit at the WZB focuses on the political economy of social and political inequality. 

Our research concentrates on four clusters: **vertical linkages**, **horizontal contestation**, **exclusion**, and **elite connections**. These clusters stem from a focus on two types of social division: **horizontal divisions** between identity groups, and **vertical divisions** between those that have more or less political power. 

More about our research group can be found [here](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development/institutions-and-political-inequality).

See [here](https://wzb-ipi.github.io/assets/slides/ipi.html) for a presentation of our research.
